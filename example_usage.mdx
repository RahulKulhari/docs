This guide provides practical examples of how to use the Nucleus and Taxonomy APIs. We'll cover common scenarios for both APIs using curl commands.

### Nucleus API Examples

#### User Authentication

To use the Nucleus API, you first need to authenticate:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "your_username", "password": "your_password"}'
```

This will return an access token that you'll use for subsequent requests.

#### Creating a Vacancy

To create a new vacancy:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/vacancies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "external_id": "JOB123",
    "job_title": "Software Engineer",
    "job_description": "We are looking for a talented software engineer...",
    "language": "English",
    "company": "Tech Innovators Inc.",
    "location": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "California",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "domain": "Software Development",
    "work_ex": {
      "min": 2,
      "max": 5
    }
  }'
```

#### Searching Vacancies

To search for vacancies:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/vacancies/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Software Engineer",
    "company": "Tech Innovators Inc.",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

### Taxonomy API Examples

#### Creating a Function

To create a new function:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/functions/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function_name": "Software Development",
    "source": {
      "is_vacancy": true
    }
  }'
```

#### Adding a Skill

To add a new skill:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/skills/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skill_name": "Python Programming"
  }'
```

#### Creating a Taxonomy

To create a new taxonomy entry:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/taxonomy/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    {
      "function": "Software Development",
      "skill_category": "Programming Languages",
      "skill": "Python Programming",
      "is_validated": true
    }
  ]'
```

#### Searching Skills

To search for skills:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/skills/search/?query=python" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Combining the APIs

You can use both APIs together to create powerful applications. For example, you might:

1. Use the Nucleus API to create a new vacancy
2. Use the Taxonomy API to categorize the skills required for the vacancy
3. Use the Taxonomy API's search functionality to find related skills or functions
4. Update the vacancy in the Nucleus API with the additional information

This combination allows for rich, structured job postings with standardized skill taxonomies.

Remember to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual authentication credentials. Also, adjust the API URLs to match your actual API endpoints.

These examples should help you get started with the Nucleus and Taxonomy APIs. For more detailed information on each endpoint, please refer to the [API Reference](api-reference) section.
