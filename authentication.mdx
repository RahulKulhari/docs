This guide explains how to authenticate your requests to the Nucleus and Taxonomy APIs.
Each API uses a different authentication method, so we'll cover both separately.'

### Nucleus API Authentication
The Nucleus API uses a token-based authentication system. You need to obtain an access token by logging in, and then use this token for subsequent requests.

#### Obtaining an Access Token

To get an access token, make a POST request to the `/login` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'
```

If the credentials are correct, you'll receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

#### Using the Access Token

For all subsequent requests to the Nucleus API, include this token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/vacancies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

Replace `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` with your actual access token.

#### Token Expiration

Access tokens typically have an expiration time. If your token expires, you'll need to log in again to obtain a new one.

### Taxonomy API Authentication

The Taxonomy API uses API key authentication. You need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests.

#### Obtaining an API Key

To get an API key for the Taxonomy API:

1. [Sign up for an account](#) (if you haven't already)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy your new API key and store it securely

#### Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests to the Taxonomy API:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/functions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

### Best Practices for API Key Security

To keep your API keys and access tokens secure:

1. Never share your API keys or access tokens publicly or commit them to version control.
2. Use environment variables to store your API keys and access tokens in your applications.
3. Implement proper error handling in your applications to avoid exposing API keys in error messages or logs.
4. Regularly rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
5. Use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure your API key is encrypted in transit.

### Rate Limiting

Both APIs implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- Nucleus API: The specific rate limits are not provided in the OpenAPI specification. Please check with the API provider for details.
- Taxonomy API: The rate limits are not specified in the OpenAPI document. Contact the API provider for information on rate limits.

If you exceed the rate limits, you may receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response. Implement appropriate backoff and retry logic in your applications to handle rate limiting.

### Error Handling

Both APIs use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. If authentication fails, you may receive a 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) status code.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid authentication credentials"
}
```

Always check the HTTP status code and response body to handle authentication errors appropriately in your applications.

### Need Help?

If you're having trouble authenticating or need to request changes to your API access, please contact our support team:

- Taxonomy API: [support@taxonomyapi.com](mailto:support@taxonomyapi.com)

Remember, your API keys and access tokens are secret. If you believe they have been compromised, regenerate them immediately from your dashboard and update your applications accordingly.
